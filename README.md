# TkGesture - A Simple Mouse and Keyboard Gesture App

TkGesture is a lightweight tkinter application that captures and responds to mouse and keyboard events. It provides a red canvas where users can interact using various mouse gestures, such as clicks, movement, and double-clicks, as well as keyboard inputs (if extended). The app is useful for experimenting with event handling in tkinter and can be a foundation for gesture-based applications like drawing tools or interactive UI prototypes.

Features:
- Detects mouse clicks, movement, and pointer entry/exit events
- Provides a basic framework for implementing gesture-based interactions
- Easily extendable to support keyboard events and additional gestures
